# Starwars Planets Search 

This project was developed while I was studying Context API and React Hooks at Trybe Programming School.

I developed an application that makes a request to an external API to get data about different planets in the Star Wars Universe.

I used the data returned by the API to create a table with some filters. Planets can be filtered by their name and their characteristics, such as population, orbital period, diameter and others.

I also developed unit/integration tests using the React Testing Library.

To ensure code quality, the `ESLint` and `Stylelint` linters were used in this project.

ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. In many ways it is similar to JSLint and JSHint with a few exceptions:

* ESLint uses Espree for JavaScript parsing.
* ESLint uses an AST to evaluate patterns in code.
* ESLint is completely 'pluggable', each of the rules is a plugin and you can add […]

To run them locally, run the commands below:
`npm run lint`
`npm run lint:styles`
